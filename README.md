# kafka-protobuf-producer

This project has been inspired from

https://github.com/yogeshsr/kafka-protobuf-console-consumer/

I noticed a small use case of creating a kafka protobuf producer - with
different UI like CLI, GUI (Web) and maybe even try out different languages -
like Java, Go, at least those are the ones I'm well accustomed to.

This is just a pet project. Please use it with caution if using for very
critical use cases. I'm only planning to use this tool for development and
testing purposes at the max, but this is mostly a fun project than for
development / testing in my current work.
